Day 1,
Using rust for it's fast performance and memory saftey
Using vulkan for cross platform compatibility. Not using wgpu because of the abstraction, I want to learn as much as possible

Day 3,
I've decided that to build a good habit of programming, I'm going to make at least one commit a day to this project. Kind of like a duolingo style approach.
