Not to be confused with a Shader Stage

"_Shader modules_ contain _shader code_ and one or more entry points. Shaders are selected from a shader module by specifying an entry point as part of [pipeline](https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/pipelines.html#pipelines) creation."

Shader module code is in SPIR-V format (Standard Portable Intermediate Representation Format - Vulkan)
